Now Green Code you must
# Moss
Junction 2022- why moss? because it's a shade of green.
The IT industry's share of global electricity consumption is currently 5-9%. 
There are predictions that it will rise to as much as 21% by 2030. 
So in the IT field we have more and more responsibility for the energy consumption of systems.
Green Coding is greener approach to implement and run software.

This challenge is about innovating ways to implement applications in a more energy-efficient manner. 
Energy-efficient solutions can include things like avoiding unnecessary processing, optimizing capacity use, 
using energy-efficient programming languages, using energy-efficient file formats, the application can have an eco-mode, 
screen color choices can influence energy consumption and so on.
